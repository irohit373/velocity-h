## Getting Started

we are using pnpm instead of npm because of its performance and efficient package management.

if pnpm in not installed globally, you can install it via npm:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

Then run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
cd web-app
pnpm install
```
For running the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

I added daisyUI in the dependencies, so don't worry to add it and added the Daisy MCP server yeah help karega github copilot ko code likhne mein aur daisy ui ke components ko samajhne mein. taki tum chat mein daisy ui se acche se code mangwa sako (maybe complicated for you, if smj na aayein toh contact kareh) . Below is the link to daisy ui documentation and editor.
https://daisyui.com/docs/editor/

Now go through the nextJS lecture
then go with the tailwindcss(if you want maybe u don't want it) and then with the daisyUI lec it don't take a lot of time and then play with the code.

now u should create a new branch for your work

```bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name (esha-ui)
```

and start building and don't forget to commit your changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "your commit message"
git push origin your-branch-name (esha-ui)
```
